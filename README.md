***Flashcards System done in Next.Js for fun***
***
A flashcard system done in Next JS really just for my own studies.  Uses markdown for the Deck template, but still have some parsing work to be done, as well as an importation system.  The overall goal here is to allow an enduser to create flashcards via markdown files, which will then be parsed into JSON and rendered into React flashcards with questions on the front / multiple choices, and correct answer explanation on the flip side.
