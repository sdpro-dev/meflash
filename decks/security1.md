**Question 24**
Tim, a help desk technician, receives a call from a frantic executive who
states that their company issued smartphone was stolen during their lunch
meeting with a rival company’s executive. Tim quickly checks the MDM
administration tool and identifies that the user’s smartphone is still
communicating with the MDM and displays the location of the device on a map.
What should Tim do next to ensure the data on the stolen device remains
confidential and inaccessible to the thief??

**Answers**
* Reset the device's password
* Perform a remote wipe of the device (Correct)
* Remotely encrypt the device
* Identify the IP address of the smartphone
  
**Explanation**
To ensure the data remains confidential and is not accessed by the thief,
Tim should perform a remote wipe of the device from the MDM. This will
ensure any and all corporate data is erased prior to anyone accessing it.
Additionally, Tim could reset the device's password, but if the thief is
able to guess or crack the password, then they would have access to the
data. Identifying the IP address of the smartphone is not a useful step in
protecting the data on the device. Additionally, devices should be encrypted
BEFORE they are lost or stolen, not after, therefore the option to remotely
encrypt the device was provided as a wrong answer and distraction.
